# NFL Dashboard

## High Level

The goal of this repository is to create a dashboard which will synthesize data from a few different resources and in turn aid in making sports bets/summaries. 

## Short term

The first focal point of this project will be to create functional dashboard using a scalable web framework (django) to create an appealing dashboard.

## Longer term

In the longer term, this project can be expanded into a few different directions: 
* Backend: To build out a database and learn integration with the frontend
* APIs: create REST api's to provide different types of advanced functionality and well as information on what is supported in this application
* Automation orchestration: When developing complex processes, automation is a powerful concept but must be used well
* Hosting/service: Deploying the dashboard on a server to learn development and about how services are hosted
